An interactive and animated **Selection Sort algorithm visualizer** built using **JavaScript and D3.js**, designed to make algorithm learning intuitive through real-time visual feedback and user-controlled animations.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To simplify the understanding of **Selection Sort** by visually demonstrating each step of the algorithm. This project is especially useful for **students, educators, and beginners** learning algorithms and data structures.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🎲 Random Array Generation  
Generate an array of 20 random integers (range: 10–99), displayed as vertical bars for easy comparison.

### 🌀 Live Sorting Animation  
Watch the Selection Sort algorithm in action as elements are compared, minimum values are selected, and swaps are performed in real time.

### 🎨 Color-Coded Visualization  
- **Current index:** Yellow  
- **Minimum element:** Red  
- **Swapped elements:** Green  
- **Sorted section:** Light Blue  

### ⏸️ Pause & Stop Controls  
Pause or stop the animation at any moment to analyze or explain individual steps.

### 💬 Real-Time Status Updates  
Dynamic text explanations describe the current operation during the sorting process.

### 🌙 Dark Mode Support  
Toggle between light and dark themes with full UI adaptation for improved readability.

### ⚡ Speed Control  
Adjust animation speed to suit different learning preferences.

### 🔁 Rewind Capability  
Step backward to revisit previous operations in the sorting sequence.

### 📈 Performance Analysis *(Planned)*  
Graphical comparison of **best, average, and worst-case time complexities** using Chart.js.
